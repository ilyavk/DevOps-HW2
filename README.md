A blackjack game that incorporates unit and integration testing written in Python for CS491 DevOps at UNR

In Python, create a simple Black Jack game. Play should occur based on the following rules: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/ (Links to an external site.).  
The game only needs to accommodate one player. There should be a "dealer" following the Dealer's Play rules. I suggest you include classes for those components and at least an additional Blackjack controller and the actual game driver which manages the console UI.  
Create a suite of unit tests for your basic functionality and integration tests for wherever your classes interact with each other.
